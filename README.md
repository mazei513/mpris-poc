# MPRIS zbus PoC

Was trying to figure out how to use the `zbus` crate to interact with MPRIS, specifically on
listening for changes in the MPRIS players available. Its mostly to figure out in the context of
integrating into `ashell` for improving the Media Player module.

Also I'm learning Rust so I kinda needed a smaller thing to figure out async Rust rather than
working directly on the `ashell` codebase to figure this out.
